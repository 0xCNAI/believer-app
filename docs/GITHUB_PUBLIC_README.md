# Believer - Market Structure Observer

> **Disclaimer**: This project is a **data visualization and research tool** focused on analyzing market structures and information flow. It does **not** provide investment advice, trading signals, or financial services.

## Overview

**Believer** is a mobile application framework designed to visualize complex market data structures. It focuses on how information spreads and aggregates into what we term "Market Consensus."

By aggregating various data points—ranging from technical indicators to liquidity metrics—Believer transforms noise into structured, observable indices. This allows researchers and developers to study market volatility and trend formation from a purely structural perspective (Structure-First Approach).

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate:
1.  **React Native & Expo Application Architecture**: A reference implementation for a modern, performant mobile app.
2.  **Visualization of Abstract Data**: Techniques for rendering complex, abstract "belief" or "consensus" states into user-friendly UI components.
3.  **State Management**: efficient handling of real-time data streams and local state synchronization.

## Features

-   **Market State Observation**: Real-time rendering of technical structure indices.
-   **Consensus Visualization**: Interactive UI elements that represent the aggregation of market signals.
-   **Event Stream Processing**: A unified timeline for observing categorized market events.

## Tech Stack

-   **Framework**: React Native (Expo Router)
-   **Styling**: Native StyleSheet & Layout Animation
-   **State Management**: Zustand
-   **Storage**: Async Storage

## Safety & Compliance

This tool is strictly an **observer**. It is designed with the following safety principles:
-   **No Trading Execution**: The app cannot execute trades or connect to exchange transaction APIs.
-   **Neutral Language**: All event descriptions are generated to be objective and descriptive.
-   **Privacy First**: User interaction data is stored locally for personalization and is not monetized.
